abstract = {Summary In this study, we determined that operator positioning precision contributes significant measurement error in high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). Moreover, we developed software to quantify intra- and inter-operator variability and demonstrated that standard positioning training (now available as a web-based application) can significantly reduce inter-operator variability. Introduction HR-pQCT is increasingly used to assess bone quality, fracture risk, and anti-fracture interventions. The contribution of the operator has not been adequately accounted in measurement precision. Operators acquire a 2D projection ("scout view image") and define the region to be scanned by positioning a "reference line" on a standard anatomical landmark. In this study, we (i) evaluated the contribution of positioning variability to in vivo measurement precision, (ii) measured intra- and inter-operator positioning vari- ability, and (iii) tested ifcustom training software led to supe- rior reproducibility in new operators compared to experienced operators. Methods To evaluate the operator in vivo measurement precision, we compared precision errors calculated in 64 co-registered and non-co-registered scan-rescan images. To quantify operator variability, we developed software that simulates the positioning process of the scanner'ssoftware. Eight expe- rienced operators positioned reference lines on scout view images designed to test intra- and inter-operator reproducibility. Finally, we developed modules for training and evaluation ofreference line positioning.We enrolled six new operators to participate in a common training, followed by the same repro- ducibility experiments performed by the experienced group. Results In vivo precision errors were up to threefold greater (Tt.BMD and Ct.Th) when variability in scan positioning was included. The inter-operator precision errors were significant- ly greater than the short-term intra-operator precision (p {\textless} 0.001). New trained operators achieved comparable intra-operator reproducibility to experienced operators and lower inter-operator reproducibility (p {\textless}0.001). Precision er- rors were significantly greater for the radius than for the tibia. Conclusion Operator reference line positioning contributes significantly to in vivo measurement precision and is significantly greater for multi-operator datasets. Inter-operator variability can be significantly reduced using a systematic training platform, now available online (http://webapps.radiology. ucsf.edu/refline/).},
