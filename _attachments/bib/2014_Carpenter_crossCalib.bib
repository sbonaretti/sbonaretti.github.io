abstract = {In multicenter studies and longitudinal studies that use two or more different quantitative computed tomography (QCT) imaging systems, anthropomorphic standardization phantoms (ASPs) are used to correct inter-scanner differences and allow pooling of data. In this study, in vivo imaging of 20 women on two imaging systems was used to evaluate inter-scanner differences in hip integral BMD (iBMD), trabecular BMD (tBMD), cortical BMD (cBMD), femoral neck yield moment (My) and yield force (Fy), and finite-element derived strength of the femur under stance (FEstance) and fall (FEfall) loading. Six different ASPs were used to derive inter-scanner correction equations. Significant (p{\textless}0.05) inter-scanner differences were detected in all measurements except My and FEfall, and no ASP-based correction was able to reduce inter-scanner variability to corresponding levels of intra-scanner precision. Inter-scanner variability was considerably higher than intra-scanner precision, even in cases where the mean inter-scanner difference was statistically insignificant. A significant (p{\textless}0.01) effect of body size on inter-scanner differences in BMD was detected, demonstrating a need to address the effects of body size on QCT measurements. The results of this study show that significant inter-scanner differences in QCT-based measurements of BMD and bone strength can remain even when using an ASP.},
