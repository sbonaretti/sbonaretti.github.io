abstract = {Summary We investigated the sensitivity of distal bone den- sity, structure, and strength measurements by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to variability in limb length. Our results demonstrate that HR- pQCT should be performed at a standard {\%}-of-total-limb- length to avoid substantial measurement bias in population study comparisons and the evaluation of individual skeletal status in a clinical context. Introduction High-resolution peripheral quantitative comput- ed tomography (HR-pQCT) measures ofbone do not account for anatomic variability in bone length: a 1-cm volume is acquired at a fixed offset from an anatomic landmark. Our goal was to evaluate HR-pQCT measurement variability introduced by imaging fixed vs. proportional volumes and to propose a standard protocol for relative anatomic positioning. Methods Double-length (2-cm) scans were acquired in 30 adults. We compared measurements from 1-cm sub-volumes located at the default fixed offset, and the average {\%}-of-length offset. The average position corresponded to 4.0{\%} ± 1.1 mm for radius, and 7.2{\%} ± 2.2 mm for tibia. We calculated the RMS difference in bone parameters and T-scores to determine the measurement variability related to differences in limb length. We used anthropometric ratios to estimate the mean limb length for published HR-pQCT reference data, and then calculated mean {\%}-of-length offsets. Results Variability between fixed vs. relative scan positions was highest in the radius, and for cortical bone in general (RMS difference Ct.Th = 19.5{\%}), while individuals had T- score differentials as high as +3.0 SD (radius Ct.BMD). We estimated that average scan position for published HR-pQCT reference data corresponded to 4.0{\%} at the radius, and 7.3{\%} at tibia. Conclusion Variability in limb length introduces significant bias to HR-pQCT measures, confounding cross-sectional analyses and limiting the clinical application for individual assessment of skeletal status. We propose to standardize scan positioning using 4.0 and 7.3{\%} of total bone length for the distal radius and tibia, respectively.},
