My personal website: https://sbonaretti.github.io/   

Developed in python using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/). The layout theme is [sphinx-bootstrap-theme](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/)

Content:

- `*.html`: pages of the website, created locally in the folder `build/html`  
- `objects.inv`: file connecting style and text  
- `.nojekyll`: tells GitHub not to use jekyll (default for websites)  
- `_attachments`: contains papers, CV, etc.  
- `_images`: contains figures  
- `_static`: contains layout
- `source`: source code as structured locally  

Note: the `*.html` files, `objects.inv`, and the `_*` folders are locally generated in the folder `build`
